# My_Repo – Harhu's Code Lab 🚀

This is my personal space to explore, build, and experiment with new ideas.  
All the things I learn, try, or create will be stored and updated here.  
It’s like my digital playground for growth and discovery.




## 📁 Repository Structure

The folder structure and sections will be updated as I build and add new projects here.


## 💡 Purpose

This repo is created to keep all my learning, side-projects, and tech experiments in one place.  
It helps me track my progress and stay consistent while improving my skills every day.
